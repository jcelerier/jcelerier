It enables artists to create interactive and intermedia scores in a visual environment, to script and live-code with JavaScript, ISF Shaders, Faust, PureData or even C++. It is compatible with IoT protocols such as CoAP or MQTT, and enables interactions with joysticks, Wiimotes, Leapmotions, Web APIs, BLE sensors, and much more.",

These nodes/parameters can have attributes, which allow to declare many of their properties, such as their values, types, units, ranges, etc. This OSC tree-based architecture  can then be exposed over the network under several protocols, some of which allow this architecture, and the properties and values of its nodes, to be fully explored and queried. For now, protocols available in the implementations are: plain OSC, OSCquery, and Minuit - more are part of libossia and will be made available in the future. libossia offers bindings and implementations for several environments: PureData, Max/MSP, Python, C, C++, openframeworks, Unity3D, QML, Faust, SuperCollider.",
